# Constructors

## Description
Copy the included `constructors.js` to a new project.
Test consistently using `nodemon constructors.js` to see the file output every time you save.

Keep in mind in the `console.assert` statements in `constructors.js` I should be able to run this file with `node` or `nodemon` and see no Assertion Errors.
Your code should also pass `jscs` and `jshint` errors.

Code is in place that validates each answer.
It will currently say: `Assertion failed` for each question along with a sane message of why things failed.
Once you answer the question correctly that will go away.
Use this to check your work.
When all assertion errors go away, you should be done.


## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should…

* Understand how constructor functions work in JavaScript
* Understand how prototypes work in JavaScript


### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use constructor functions and prototypes to create reusable object types


### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  - the `constructors.js` file
  - a `.jscs` file to configure `jscs`
  - NO OTHER FILES!

### Requirements

* Assertions Passing For Problem 1
* Assertions Passing For Problem 2
* Assertions Passing For Problem 3
* Assertions Passing For Problem 4
* Assertions Passing For Problem 5
* No JSHint warnings or errors
* No JSCS warnings or errors

* Hard Mode
    * Assertions Passing for Bonus Problem 


## Hard Mode
In the `constructors.js` there is a bonus question at the bottom. This is your hard mode.
